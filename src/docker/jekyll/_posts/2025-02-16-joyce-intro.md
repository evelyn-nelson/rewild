Evelyn and I put Flinta Forum together today because we wanted to create a platform for writing and idle thoughts not subject to capture by social media. She’s been working with Esti on a platform, Rewild, to self-publish a website from your own computer.

What better use-case than a local little website where we can host tidbits from our local friends? Are you a friend? Maybe you want to be on this thing. We just added our friend Plum and are hoping that she doesn’t stir up too much shit. She’s known to burn bridges.

Flinta Forum was Em. J’s coinage. I was thinking of “Flinta Bulletin” — that it could be like the bulletin board in Animal Crossing. Stuff of not terrible consequence, but stuff that lasts, that you can go back and look at, by people you care about.

We’ll see what I put on here. Maybe a little public diary, things I do and see. See you soon!
